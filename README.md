This code is designed to be an in client memory mangement system. The javascript will take a snapshot of the users current tabs across all windows, capturing all live processes currently running on Chrome's internal task manager. From these processes, I then build an array of JSON Objects with defined properties.

This code is attempting to create several instences of a JSON Object, Tab, with the captured information from processes. The most important capture is private memory allocated, and is only available as part of a callback from onUpdatedWithMemory. An eventListener gets the update ping and returns a dictionary of process Objects that can then be manipulated. 

An if statement detects that a process is a tab that process has an array of length 1 associated with the process object. If true, I call my constructor for the tab Object and pass it in the relevant parameters. A global array is declared to house these objects. The constructor pushes the derived Object to the global array on every call. 

Once I have a complete one-dimensional array of Objects, I can then sort the Objects based on their respective allocated memory attribute (Tabs[i].allocd_mem). I pass the attribute as a string, and use a ternery operator to determine how to sort. Once sorted, I can generate the HTML table for popup.html.  

Note:
- in order to debug this, right click the broswer-action icon and select "inspect popup". Extensions use a 
different console which means that "console.log(arg);" will not work. Use "console.debug(arg);" for simple debugging, and "console.dir(arg);" if you want print a manipulatable representation of an object.

Currently working on:

- dynamically creating the DOM with appropriate bootstrap classes
- close button eventListener to remove table row of terminated tab
